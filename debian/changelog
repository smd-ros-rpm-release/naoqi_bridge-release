ros-indigo-naoqi-tools (0.4.3-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * naoqui_tools not depending on robot descriptions
    I was gonna test Nao in ROS and, hopefully, in Gazebo. I didn't find any updated guide on that so I'm just debugging as I work.
    I did a:
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
    On a workspace with only ```nao_robot``` and ```naoqi_bridge``` and I got:
    ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
    naoqi_tools: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [romeo_description]
    As it's named "tools" I think that maybe it shouldn't depend on the robots descriptions (or you'll need all of them in the workspace!).
