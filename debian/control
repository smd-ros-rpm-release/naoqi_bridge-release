Description: Driver package for the Naoqi robot, providing access to walking commands, joint angles, and sensor data (odometry, IMU, ...). The most-current version is compatible with the Nao API version 1.12 or newer, connecting to a real or simulated Nao by wrapping Aldebaran Robotics' NaoQI API in Python. This requires the &quot;lib&quot; directory of the Aldebaran Python SDK to be in your PYTHONPATH environment variable. Note that cameras drivers are provided in a separate package (naoqi_sensors).
